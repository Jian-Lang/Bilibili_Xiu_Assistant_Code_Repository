## I.Personal Summary of The Course

At the beginning of this part, I should put the link of my first blog:

✳️ **What I have achieved**

1️⃣ I have achieved real development experience in both Android development(Bobing Game) and Wechat mini program development. Both of them let me obtain a lot.

2️⃣ I have the chance to convert the theoritical knowlegde in computer network to the real work: I solved domain name resolution problem and have my own legal domain name. These are finished by both my theoritical knowledge and practical experience.

3️⃣ How to work as a team. In this course, I am honored to be the team leader of team "Langcant互联网股份有限公司". During the whole process of development, I played many roles in the team. Firstly, I am the leader and product manager of the team. I pushed the whole development process of the team and make proper work division based on members' strength. And I also make a lot of product requirements and realize these requirements with my team members. Secondly, I am the front-end developer leader of the team. Because I have some experience in front-end development(I have learned it one year ealier),  I have the ability to lead our front-end development. Finally, I am also the recorder. Almostly all the blogs about our teamwork are written by me. But in the end, I want to say thanks to all of my team members with their coorperation and patience.

------

✴️ **What I have not improved**

1️⃣ The most important aspect I want to development, "Algorithms and data structures", is not improved. But I am not that sad because I will use another time to finish this. (I will major in software engineering in postgraduate).

2️⃣ ...I think that's all.

------

🔯 **Q & A**

**1️⃣ Count how many lines of code you have completed in this software engineering practice.**

4494 lines（2992 in mini program project and 1502 in Bobing Game).

------

**2️⃣ How much time does each operation of software engineering practice take? (Make a list)**

|  Operation   | Time |
| :----------: | :--: |
| Writing Blog | 20%  |
|    Coding    | 60%  |
| Exploration  | 20%  |

------

**3️⃣ Which assignment impressed you most? Why?**

![ic_launcher](C:\Users\大瞎蘸酱\Desktop\Bilibili咻管家项目\博客\12pic\ic_launcher.png)

I think Bobing Game assignment impressed me most. During summer holiday, I have learned a lot about Android development. This assignment give me a chance to develop Android practically. 

------

**4️⃣ How many hours have you spent on softwork practice? How many hours per week on average?**

If you ask me the specific time, I must say countless. Maybe 20h per week?😅

------

**5️⃣ What new software has been learned and used?**

**Hbuilder X**. This software is used to development mobile app with uniapp framework. I adopt to use uniapp framework to develop our miniprogram instead of traditional Wechat framework.

**StarUML.** This is used to draw UML diagram.

------

**6️⃣ What new tools have been learned and used?**

**Typora**. I use it to edit my CSDN blogs.

![3](C:\Users\大瞎蘸酱\Desktop\Bilibili咻管家项目\博客\12pic\3.jpg)

But I also become more familiar with some tools I have learned before：**Wechat Developer Tools**, **Snipaste**, **VS Code**, **Android Studio**...

------

**7️⃣ What new languages, platforms and methods have been learned and mastered?**

No new languages. But I become more familiar with some languages I have learned before: **JAVA**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, **Vue.js**....

## II.**The Mythical Man-Month**

![s2685011](C:\Users\大瞎蘸酱\Desktop\Bilibili咻管家项目\博客\12pic\s2685011.jpg)

I think the most important case summary I want to write is about uploading miniprogram into Wechat public platform. 

One day, when my team have finished the miniprogram and planned to upload it into Wechat public platform, then tragedy happened. We do not have a domain name with our server since we always use ip address to visit the back-end. However, Wechat public platform do not allow us to use ip address as legal api. 

Then we waste two weeks waiting our domain become legal and then resolve the domain name to the server. If at first we know that, we will not waste these two weeks. And that's why I want to write this case as a summary.

## III.Suggestions

**1️⃣** **To Me at the Beginning**

I will suggest myself to change the topic of a small program. Our current topic is limited in many aspects due to various reasons  

------

**2️⃣ To Mr. Zhang**

I think if a class has its own teaching task, then just do that is enough. If you want to change the teaching task, please change it absolutely. Do not do each a half. 

I mean if you want us to learn theoritical knowledge about software engineering, then you just teach the theoritical knowledge and we just learn about that. If you want to teach practical knowledge, then we just do practical exercise and this is enough. Now things become that we should not only do practical exercise, for example, we have finished two real software development, but also we have the theoritical exam. This is not that reasonable.

------

**3️⃣ Change Team Players or Not**

I think I will not change this. In the process of doing one programming task or project after another, not only individuals are improved, but also the teamwork ability of the whole team is improved. Therefore, I think it is important to keep team members constant when the team works well together.

------

## IV.Team Analysis

As the team leader, I should give the conclusion about our team stage. I think we have reached "creation" stage. 

At the begining, I build the team with my four friends. People perfer to do things with people familiar. But at that time, I have some worring about how to manage the members because they are also my friends. However, after finishing tasks one by one, I can see a great spirit of solidarity in our team. None of them say they do not want to or they do not have time to do, they just say, "Ok, let me do this and later give you response". I think this is the stage of "creation".

With this "creation", this week we launch our Wechat miniprogram "Bilibili_Xiu Assistant" V1.0.3 in Wechat Platform. This can also proof my point.

## V.Proof of Software Engineering Learning

During this course, my team and I have finished two software development. 

The first one is **Bobing Game**, and this is the GitHub link about it:

| ✨ Bobing Game Source Code Link ✨ | https://github.com/LobsterJian/BobingGame.git |      |

The second one is **Bilibili Xiu Assistant mini program,** and the following are the GitHub link and QR Code about it:

And here is the user data about our mini program:
