## II.So far and Future

In our sprint plan, we said that we planned to realize login and registration functions. 

***So far, we have realized:***

✅ **Register a New Account.** Users now can register a new account with typing his nickname, password, Bilibili UID and a **profile picture**.

✅ **Judge whether a Bilibili UID is correct or not**. Users can not type wrong Bilibili UID to register a new account since we realize to judge if a UID is correct or not.

✅ **Login with correct username and password.** Users now can login using his account. However, if a username is not existed or the password is wrong, then they can not access to our mini program.

✅ **Profile uploading.** Users now can upload their prefer profile image as his profile and it will be displayed in his personal page. (The demo video can be found at the begining, it shows all the functions)

✨ So totally, **we have finished 120% of our alpha sprint plan**. (Maybe 20% of whole project)

------

***In next stage, we want to:***

1️⃣ Realize **xiu_friend function**.(1 week,10% of whole)

2️⃣ Realize **search function**.(1 week,15% of whole)

3️⃣ Realize **special care function**.(1 week,55% of whole)

## III.Process experience of each member

1️⃣ ***Leader：Jian Lang***

![lj](C:\Users\大瞎蘸酱\Desktop\Bilibili咻管家项目\博客\1-7天通用\pic\lj.jpg)

During this hard but happy spell, I have two outcomes. Firstly, I learned a lot about uni-app front-end frame. This frame is quite different from traditional H5 or vue. Before this sprint, I am familiar with H5 and vue. But now I learned a lot about uni-app frame and I must say that this frame is more suitable to mobile-end development. Secondly, I learned how to work with team members as a leader. During this process, I usually talk to each members,asked them to do something or to return something to me. Also, I think they are the best! Finally, I should say, we will continue working for this mini-program until it is finished up to 100%.

2️⃣ ***Team Member：Wei Xie***

![xw](C:\Users\大瞎蘸酱\Desktop\Bilibili咻管家项目\博客\1-7天通用\pic\xw.png)

In the past, I learned the actual combat of projects that do not separate the front and back ends. For the first time, I realized the separation of the front and back ends, and operated the cloud server, Tomcat, flask restful and other frameworks. I gained a lot. In this sprint, I also exercised my team consciousness and negotiation skills, which is of profound significance for personal development and future team cooperation.

3️⃣ ***Team Member：Yuxiang He***

![hyx](C:\Users\大瞎蘸酱\Desktop\Bilibili咻管家项目\博客\1-7天通用\pic\hyx.jpg)

Before this project, I had not used the requests library of Python. After these days of study and practice, I am proficient in how to search, obtain and process data. At the same time, in the process of cooperation with teammates, I learned how to realize the data interaction between the front end and the back end. Meanwhile, my teamwork ability has also been improved in this project. I learned how to negotiate and communicate with the project manager, understand the difficulties of software development. It was a great experience!

4️⃣ ***Team Member：Diancong Wu***

![wdc](C:\Users\大瞎蘸酱\Desktop\Bilibili咻管家项目\博客\1-7天通用\pic\wdc.jpg)

In the past seven days, I've learned a lot of useful front-end knowledge and laid a good foundation. And learned a variety of programming languages. In this process, my teammates and I cooperated with each other, developed and applied the knowledge we had mastered in practice, exercised my teamwork ability and improved my cognition and understanding of the team.

------

5️⃣ ***Team Member：Zekai Wang***

![wqc](C:\Users\大瞎蘸酱\Desktop\Bilibili咻管家项目\博客\1-7天通用\pic\wqc.jpg)

I've never studied either the front end or the back end before. After this period of time, I learned a lot, especially the life cycle of the formation, drop-down refresh and other parts of the knowledge is very impressive to me. I used to be confused and annoyed by this knowledge, but I have mastered it through communication with other members and searching for answers online. At the same time, I also improved the ability of mutual communication and cooperation with partners, I believe that this experience is a rare precious wealth in my life.
