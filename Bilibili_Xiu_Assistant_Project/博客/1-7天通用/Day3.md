## I.Progress Display

The following table shows our progress today:

|   Member    |                        Completed Task                        | Time to Complete | Remaining Time |
| :---------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------: | :------------: |
|  Jian Lang  | Develop the first front-end version of mini project, which has included all the pages. Login and Registeration in front-end now have been realized. |        5h        |      23h       |
|   Wei Xie   | Learn using flask-restful api for complex output json data  and using mysql database in flask to operate |        6h        |      24h       |
| Yuxiang He  | Learned how to use Python's requests library to obtain the required data. Learned to use Python to process JSON data format. |        7h        |      34h       |
| Diancong Wu | Hands-on programming and attempted to write the first page. Learned in detail about the WeChat development platform's own function library. |        6h        |      30h       |
| Zekai Wang  | Continue yesterday's learning, more in-depth understanding of front-end development, but relatively complex issues (such as component life cycle, etc.) are still a big problem. |        5h        |      33h       |

------

‚ú¥Ô∏è ***Problems Encountered:***

1Ô∏è‚É£ Page layout errors.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data types in JSON format cannot be extracted directly.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The video tutorials are too little about these difficulties, and I, a front-end beginner, still have a lot of confusion. The current problem has not been solved for the time being, and I hope to continue my efforts to solve it tomorrow

------

‚ú≥Ô∏è ***The way to deal with:***

1Ô∏è‚É£ Kept trying and solving problems.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Use the format converter and the plug-in in pycharm to format JSON data, and then we can extract the data we want.
