‚ú¥Ô∏è ***Problems Encountered:***

1Ô∏è‚É£ Mistake using form to pass the result.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Find some special situations that are not considered when obtaining information, such as the searched user does not exist.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Can not realize remove of input data using :value bind.

------

‚ú≥Ô∏è ***The way to deal with:***

1Ô∏è‚É£ Using ? to pass vlaue.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Through many attempts, found the differences between the output results of these special cases and general cases, and the data returned to the back-end is changed according to these differences.

3Ô∏è‚É£ In wechat, :value should be replaced as v-model to bind data so that they can be removed.
