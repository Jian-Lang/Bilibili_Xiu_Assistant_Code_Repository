✴️ ***Problems Encountered:***

1️⃣ The first direct installation of flask failed.

2️⃣ Lack of front-end foundation, relatively unfamiliar with CSS. 

3️⃣ Due to HBuilderx version issues, there are some issues with the environment configuration running on mobile.

------

✳️ ***The way to deal with:***

1️⃣ Need to install pip package first before installing flask.

2️⃣ Supplement the knowledge reserve through self-study and learn more about the front-end foundation. 

3️⃣ A search on the HBuilderx website shows that you need to change to developer mode first.
