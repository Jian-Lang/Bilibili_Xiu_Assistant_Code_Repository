## I.Previous Work Review and Improvement

In previous four weeks, we have made following controbutions to our total project:

🌀 ***Select and Decide the Project Title:*** In week 8, we selected our project title, which is called Bilibili_xiu_assistant. It aims at providing more service to Bilibili users.

🌀 ***Make Demand Specification:*** In last two weeks(9-10), we finished the demand specification of our mini program.

🌀 ***Make a Plan and Division of the Task:*** So far, in this week, we have made a plan for our Alpha sprint and division of the task during the Alpha sprint.(I will show it later). 

------

After Alpha sprint, we want to (Plan):

✅ ***Basic Knowledge in Both Front-end and Back-end:*** After this sprint, we hope that the group members can grasp front-end knowledge or back-end knowledge (Depending on their division of the task).

**📝 Front-end:**

1️⃣ Learn basic knowledge about front-end development (**HTML, CSS, JS**).

2️⃣ Learn basic knowledge about weChat front-end development.

3️⃣ Learn basic knowledge about uni-app front-end framework and how to handle JOSN data from back-end.

**📝 Back-end:**

1️⃣ Learn flask backend frameworks and simple interactions with network.

2️⃣ Learn flask to operate databases and JSON data.

3️⃣ Learn cloud server and be familiar with the basic operation of the server.

------

✅ ***Make a Basic Version of Our Mini Program:*** After this sprint, we hope we can realize a basic version of our mini program(V1.0) which has some basic functions (But probably not all)：

1️⃣  Login and Registration.

2️⃣  Bind users with their own Bilibili uid and get their Bilibili following list.

3️⃣  Adding ***Xiu friends*** function.

## II.Team Division

Based on the basic idea of **front-end and  back-end separation**, we divide our team members into two main parts:

📕 **Front-end**: ***Jian Lang (principal)***, ***Zekai Wang***, ***Diancong Wu***
