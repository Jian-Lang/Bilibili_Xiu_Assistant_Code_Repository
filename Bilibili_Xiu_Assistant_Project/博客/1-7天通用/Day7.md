‚ú¥Ô∏è ***Problems Encountered:***

1Ô∏è‚É£ Server code will quit when the shell closed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Can not successfully send data to back-end.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The front-end has just learned for a period of time and lacks experience. There are often mistakes in programming, and the code written by myself is often far from what I actually want to achieve.

------

‚ú≥Ô∏è ***The way to deal with:***

1Ô∏è‚É£ Using nohup nohup & command to let it run background.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Set a proper request header and it can work.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Practice makes perfect.
